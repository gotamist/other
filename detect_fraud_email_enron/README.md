Projects on the Enron email dataset.

The dataset in used here is the [Enron email
dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/).

The aim is to try and identify the persons of interest (found guilty
or reached a settlement in legal proceedings in the Enron debacle) by
using other features present in the dataset such as various
compensation details and email communications.

The main file is in `fraud_from_email/poi_id.py`.  The rest of the
files are helper scripts.

This was work done for a project for Udacity's Machine Learning course
(Sebastian Thrun and Katie Malone). The starting point is the provided
starter code.
