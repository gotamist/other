# Odds and ends

Here are a few smaller items that don't really belong in the other respositories.  
One of the items is a description of the GPU-enabled machine that I built to run the projects in the other repositories as an alternative to running them on the cloud.

The other is a project for fraud detection by looking at emails from the [Enron email dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/). The task is to identify the people who were likely to have been involved in the Enron scandal by looking at a number of features, most of the relevant ones being related to their compensation details and the degree of communication they had with others who were already known to have been involved. Please see README within the directory for more.
