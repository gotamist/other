    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "The testing accuracy for all models increases as the size of the training set is increased (and correspondingly, the performance on the training set falls).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the ensemble models, AdaBoost has the best performance.  It performs better than randomforest on the test set \n",
    "\n",
    "F-score is higher than 0.7 on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also tried SVM as the base estimate.  It takes much more time to train. The same is true for KNeibhbors.  This effectively rules them out from being used in ensemble models where they'd have to be run numerous times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we set GaussianNB as the base classifier A, then using AdaBoost leaves the performance unchanged.  Presumably, this is because GaussianNB is already not a high variance model - and it's not going to be improved by the main benefit that ensemble methods offer - variance reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is suitable for the data because it inherits the speed benefits of DT (only changes by a factor or `n_estimators`) and robustness to outliers, which this dataset has.  Importances computed by this algorithm are useful to determine what the relevant variables are.  This is not a very large dataset, so overfitting is concerning and this algorithm is very good in preventing overfitting.  Several of the features might be related (for example, `education_num` and `education_level`) and the algorithm would handle that well (not treat them as independent)."

    "\n",
    "To better understand the final model, we first need to understand the decision tree model (DT). If a decision-tree idea is used to predict whether the income is greater than or less than $50,000, algorithm essentially tries to look at various features and find the level of each feature where it hopes to be able to differentiate between the high income class and the other class by making a cut at that level.  For example, it may find that people with very few years of education (for example, `educ ation_num < 4` ) are not likely to be making a high income and those with more than 15 years of education are highly likely too.  For example, while choosing if `10` or `15` is the best age boundary for differentiating high income earners from the others, it will choose the number such that data in each partition from the cut is as pure as possible (fewest misclassifications).  The data has now been \"branched\". \n",
    "\n",
    "After making a \"cut\" on one feature, the data is now partitioned into two classes and tree algorithm looks at each partition anew trying to find a feature on which to cut again using the same criterion. Further branches are thus made and as this process continues, we get a \"tree\".  Once the rules for partiioning along each feature have been decided, a new data point from the test can be classified using the same rules to make a prediction of its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is observed that if the data changes different optimal trees can be chosen based small changes in data or on choice of first cut.  So we use Random Forest (RF) to grow numerous trees on the data, randomly choosing different first cuts (roots) for the data.  Then for a new data point, let all the trees vote on their prediction of class for the new data point.  Our final output is the class chosen by a majority of the trees.  This process removes sensitivity to small perturbations and gives better performance on the testing set.  This is an improvement over DT.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further improvement is the idea of boosting.  Here, a random forest is first built on a subset of data and it when it is tested on the training data, we observe which data points have the highest error in prediction.  That's where the model needs most work.  So, another RF is now built, giving greater weight to fitting those points where the error was the greatest in the previous iteration.  Then, this new RF is again tested and we note where the greatest errors in the new round are and upweight *those* points.  This process is repeated many times to get a better and better fitting model. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the pipeline of \n",

    "`Decision Tree` -> `Ensembling (Random Forest)` -> `Boosting` yields us the best results.\n"

However, the effect was seen to be the opposite for women) and `hours-per-week` (reflecting the fact that full time work often pays more than part-time) and `age` (people often get more senior jobs later in their careers and these are paid more) to be the best predictors. \n",

However, the relationship is not linear -  The number of years of education is correlated with occupation and seniority also, but I give it lower importance due to the number of cases of enterprising people with lower education earning more than highly educated people in more stable, but lower paying jobs.  I put the hours per week lowest because in some roles related to physical labor, the supervisor, who may work less, gets paid more than the supervised person who may work longer hours.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
