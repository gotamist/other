# Traditional machine learning

This repository contains a few projects that are machine learning, but do not have a deep-learning component.  

One of the items is a description of the GPU-enabled machine that I
built to run my projects in the other repositories as an alternative
to running them on the cloud.

## Boston Housing

This famous dataset contains housing data collected back in 1978.  It
has the prices of a small number of houses - only 506.  There are 14
features available for each house.  The problem is a regression
problem.  Is it possible to use features such as the number of rooms, the neighborhood in which it is located.  The aim is learn what the selling price would be, using these features.

The problem here is an exploration of decision tree regressors, with
all its limitations and strengths, a look at bias-variance trade-off
and the use of cross-validation.

## Enron fraud detection

The other is a project for fraud detection by looking at emails from
the [Enron email dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/). The task
is to identify the people who were likely to have been involved in the
Enron scandal by looking at a number of features, most of the relevant
ones being related to their compensation details and the degree of
communication they had with others who were already known to have been
involved. Please see README within the directory for more.
